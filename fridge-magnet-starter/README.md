# Fridge Magnet

A personal shopping list and kitchen inventory app. Check items off a
categorised shopping list, then tap your phone on an NFC tag stuck to the
fridge to move everything you bought straight into your inventory.

Built with React, Supabase (PostgreSQL), and Netlify — entirely on free-tier
usage.

## Status

This is the starter scaffold from Step 1 of the build. It proves the app is
live and connected to Supabase. The shopping list, inventory, barcode
scanner and NFC sync screens are built in the steps that follow — see the
full build plan for the roadmap.

## Running this on your own computer (optional)

You do not need to do this to use the live app. If you want to run a copy
on your own machine:

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # then fill in the real Supabase anon key
npm run dev
```

## Environment variables

The app needs two values to reach its database:

- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

On the live site these are set in Netlify's dashboard under **Site
settings → Environment variables**, not in this repository, because this
repository is public.
